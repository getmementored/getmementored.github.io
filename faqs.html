						<br><br><b>1. What is this platform about?</b>

Our platform connects students with experienced mentors from various fields. Whether you need career advice, academic guidance, or insights into a specific industry, our mentors are here to help you succeed.
<br><br><b>2. How does the platform work?</b>

Students fill out a form detailing their requirements and interests. We match them with suitable mentors who can provide relevant guidance. Once the match is confirmed, students can schedule virtual meetings with their mentors through our platform.
<br><br><b>3. Is there a fee for using the platform?</b>

Yes, there might be a nominal fee associated with connecting with mentors. This fee helps us maintain the platform, verify the authenticity of mentors, and provide continuous support to both mentors and students.
<br><br><b>4. How are mentors selected?</b>

Mentors on our platform are carefully vetted professionals with significant experience in their respective fields. We assess their expertise, qualifications, and willingness to help students before onboarding them.
<br><br><b>5. Can I choose my own mentor?</b>

While students can't directly choose mentors, we match them with mentors based on their requirements and preferences. We consider factors such as industry, expertise, and availability to ensure a compatible match.
<br><br><b>6. How long is a typical mentoring session?</b>

The duration of a mentoring session varies and is typically decided by mutual agreement between the student and the mentor. Sessions can range from 30 minutes to an hour, depending on the complexity of the topic being discussed.
<br><br><b>7. What if I'm not satisfied with the mentoring session?</b>

If you're not satisfied with the session, please let us know. We value your feedback and will work to address your concerns. In certain cases, we may offer a refund or connect you with a different mentor based on your feedback.
<br><br><b>8. Is my information safe?</b>

Yes, your privacy and security are our top priorities. We use industry-standard encryption and data protection measures to safeguard your information. Your personal details are shared with mentors only after your consent, and we adhere to strict confidentiality guidelines.
<br><br><b>9. Can I connect with the same mentor again?</b>

Yes, you can reconnect with the same mentor if both parties agree. We encourage building long-term relationships with mentors for ongoing guidance and support.
<br><br><b>10. How do I provide feedback about my mentoring experience?</b>

We appreciate your feedback. After each session, you'll have the opportunity to rate your experience and provide comments. Additionally, you can always reach out to our support team with any feedback or concerns you might have.
<br><br><b>11. Can I become a mentor on this platform?</b>
